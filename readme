need to run an empty chamber simulation with same geometry and what not as i did for the one with the sample, but having issues converting the pointwise mesh to usable mesh with hegel

going to consult with vishnu on how to progress forward.

this might be that my original empty chamber database sims were not great, and it makes sense since i twisted the knob on pressure in a weird way. those simulation results may actually be inaccurate, need to read more

might have to do it once i am on the updated version of hegel.
